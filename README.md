# NestedFCV.SNF

Optimize Similairty Network Fusion (https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2810) hyper-parameters using a nested fold cross-validation (NFCV). The optimization is based on the proportion of samples assigments to the same clusters, and the assigment proportions might be corrected by the null distribution of random assigments.
